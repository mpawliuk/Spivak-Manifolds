# Introduction

This contains discussions about the book [``Calculus on Manifolds: A Modern Approach to Classical Theorems of Advanced Calculus (1965) by Michael Spivak'' by Spivak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_on_Manifolds_(book)).

It's a classic textbook about vector caluclus and differential geometry.

Our goal is to read through the entire text while also documenting our journey.
